# microp - automated hydroponic plant growth

    I am working on a project now where I am growing plants in vertically stacked hydroponic growers.  
    The nature of having vertically stacked planters means that there are a lot of plants in a small space that need to be tended to.
    The goal of the project is to automate the growing cycle to the extent possible. 

    This includes:
    - Watering
    - Feeding
    - Identifying Plant Maturity (is it ready to transplant?  ready to harvest?)
    - Identify plants in need of manual intervention
    - Provide a plant audit trail
    - Remote monitoring


    I will be documenting the build out of this system in a series of videos that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxJtzngHDaC5C4nUigdzRw)

    The code will have projects including:
    - Computer Vision models in python
    - Services in Flask and nodejs
    - UI in Next.js
    - Terraform scripts for infrastructure in AWS
    - Lambdas for event processing in AWS
    - Automated drone control for camera movement and recording
