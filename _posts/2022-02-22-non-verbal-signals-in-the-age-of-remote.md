# Getting Non-Verbal Signals When Everyone is Remote

The world has changed in the last two years. One of the ways I see it manifesting is the way in which people communicate on a daily basis at work.

There has been exhaustive research done on [the importance of non-verbal cues](https://jedfoundation.org/set-to-go/benefits-of-noticing-non-verbal-cues/) in our daily communication.  Something I have noticed in the last few years is how much of our direct communication takes place not in Zoom calls, but through chat apps like Slack.

Slack is a great productivity tool for a lot of use cases (but don't ask about search.  It's...not there yet).  The thing you don't get in chat apps though is the non-verbal cues.  The furrowing of a brow, a smile, the nodding (or not) in agreement.  These signals are important for building empathy.  

I hear some people saying "well, you can get non-verbal cues through Zoom/Teams".  It's true, you can, but what I am noticing is that video calls tend to be very heavily tactical.  Most video calls have a very specific topis, and people tend to get off of them as soon as possible.

That leaves informal communications almost entirely in the realm of text-based communication channels where context is harder to pick up on.

Some of the text-based signals that can provide context are:
- Typing for a really long time.  This can mean the sender is refining their message multiple times, which might signal unease or nervousness about the message
-
