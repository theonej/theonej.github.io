# What Are Product Outcomes?

For most of my career, I have worked in companies where software delivery is measured in terms of Outputs.  Outputs are normally thought of as the features released by the development teams and sold to customers.

Approaching software delivery as a series of outputs is very approachable.  They are easily measured, and they generally map directly to a customer ask.  It's very easy to make a direct connection between a feature being delivered and a customer that has asked for that feature, but it misses out on the broader picture of how the business is or is not impacted by the output being delivered.

The scope of [Continuous Discovery Habbits](https://www.producttalk.org/){:target="_blank"} is beyond the scope of this blog, but in essence it takes a customer-centric approach to impacting high level business outcomes, such as increasing revenue by x% or reducing churn by y%, and gives you tools to make customer-centric decisions on how to impact those outcomes.

Much of the framework we are using for our engineering groups is based on this Product approach.  What we have worked on as a compliment to these tools is the mechanics of how we introduce the concepts to the teams, how we empower them to make decisions that have real impact on the business, and putting in place a framework to allow them to think globally, act locally, and get meaningful, timely feedback.

In the next post I will talk about **[Team-Based Product Outcomes](/2022/01/26/team-based-product-outcomes)** and how we introduce the concepts to the teams.
