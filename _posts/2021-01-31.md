title: microp - automated hydroponic plant growth

![jhenry-code](./img/logo.png)

I am working on a project now where I am growing plants in vertically stacked hydroponic growers.  
The nature of having vertically stacked planters means that there are a lot of plants in a small space that need to be tended to.
The goal of the project is to automate the growing cycle to the extent possible. 

This includes:
- Watering
- Feeding
- Identifying Plant Maturity (is it ready to transplant?  ready to harvest?)
- Identify plants in need of manual intervention
- Provide a plant audit trail
- Remote monitoring


I will be documenting the build out of this system in a series of videos that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxJtzngHDaC5C4nUigdzRw)

The code will have projects including:
- Computer Vision models in python
- Services in Flask and nodejs
- UI in Next.js
- Terraform scripts for infrastructure in AWS
- Lambdas for event processing in AWS
- Automated drone control for camera movement and recording
