# What is the business case for adopting functional programming?

This is not going to be another post about what FP is, and why it has comparative advantages over some other styles.

If that is what you are looking for, please take a look at these references:

[Practical functional code in python](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming])  
This post displays insight into not only how FP is used, but also why it is popular.  The section on `Donâ€™t iterate over 
lists. Use map and reduce.` has some great examples of how to apply functions to lists.  The progression of built in functions to custom 
functions as lambdas provides an intuitive example of the balance of conciseness and function that contributes to python's popularity.

[Lambdas in c++](https://medium.com/@DakshHub/lambdas-the-companion-of-modern-c-b7dfd43b5abb)  
For fun, google `lambdas in c++` followed by `Functional Programming in c++`.  The results are geared towards very different audiences.

This article has a good section on the basics of FP, an explanation (and samples) of how c++ approaches FP.  
The discussion on `Why use Functional Programming?` describes the mechanical and efficiency advantages of FP.  
What I am hoping to do here is to discuss the financial advantages that can help make a more convincing
argument for the adoption of some FP practices.

## Financial Impact
It costs money to adopt functional practices in most cases.  There is usually the direct cost of bringing in a new team member that is familiar
and experienced with functional practices in a *production environment*.  NOTE: Candidates without production experience should be considered, but not 
as change agents or leads on the project.

Secondary financial costs can be identified in the delay to schedule while new team members are being on-boarded, compounded by the learning curve of the team as new concepts are being introduced and implemented.  Successive costs can accrue from mistakes on the part of both the new team members, not understanding the existing system adequately, and the existing team making errors in implementation of the new patterns and practices (note that the new team members who are introducing these new technologies are themselves also subject to costs associated with mistaken implementation).

The question then becomes: `If I already have a functioning production environment, that is generating revenue, why would I incur these costs?`
read: `How does that make me more money?`

And here is where I think the best case can be made for the business case to adopt FP practices.  The elements to the cost equations for most businesses I have worked for look something like this:

T = Time to revenue from concept  
D = dev team salaries/costs  
QA = A fraction ranging between 0 and &#8734; that represents the ration of QA engineers to developers  
I = Incremental profit from new initiative  
R = revenue  
B = Time boundary for the go-live event  
H = Range of hours to examine on both sides of the go-live time boundary  
P &#39; - Profit after initiative  

First we calculate the total Costs (C) for the initiative

    C = T(D + (TD * QA))
    
Next we calculate the amount of profit that the initiative recognizes by comparing two time-spans, which must be separated by a time boundary that represents the go-live time of the initiative.

    I = (R(B + H) - R(B - H)) - C

If this number is positive, you have made money.  If it is negative, you have lost money.  

And finally, the bottom line:
    P&#8242; =  P + I

Looking at the equations, there are a few levers you can pull to minimize C and maximize I.  Looking at T, we can immediately move C by reducing T.
Since QA is a multiplier on the additional dev costs (TD * QA), minimizing QA can provide returns to the bottom line.  The benefits of test automation are beyond the scope of this topic.  The argument for FP practices in this area are:
- Functional code behaves in a more deterministic manner than code that allows side effects
- Functional code naturally lends itself to testability by it's inherent structure and boundaries
- Better testability enables more rapid deployment of initiatives at lower cost

Have you ever worked on a code base that behaved strangely?  Some of the common characteristics of these code bases are:
- Little/No/Unmaintained tests
- Monolithism
- Single/Dual contributors
- Architect is no longer on the team.  No heir designated.

The first three characteristics are all symptoms of a single problem: The code is understood by too few people.  The solution to all three of these symptoms is the same: Create small, self-contained modules that are tested on every build.  Modules can be classes, they can be services, they can be plugins.  The important part of modules is that they obey the single responsibility principal, and that their interaction with the larger system can be easily understood through their interface.  Once that is in place, spooky action within the system can be reduced.

FP can help in this domain by the nature of it's structure.  The inability to render side-effects limits the amount of things that can be referenced usefully in a given function.  This characteristic makes functional code inherently testable.  Large swaths of code that have many tendrils tend to be on the wrong end of the spectrum for testability by automation, requiring human QA.

The more testable your code is by automation, the lower the QA fraction of the Cost equation.  Direct cost impact.

The incremental profit function ((R(B + H) - R(B - H)) - C) only lets us play with the H parameter, for how long we measure the experiment.  This requires that we give maximum granularity to the H parameter in order to identify performance quickly.  An additional cost that is subtly contained in the Cost function is the cost of fixing errors, including lost revenue due to errors multiplied by the time to research, diagnose, and correct errors.  FP can help to reduce errors through it's concise nature.

Maximum granularity can be achieved through high test automation and rapid deployments.  FP enables both of those scenarios, which allows us to directly impact both profit functions.
