# Engineering Roadmaps

by [Mike Donovan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldonovan2/) and J Henry

On every product team I have ever been a part of, at some point a request is made to estimate the work remaining to get to a release for some set of features.  This generally involves an arduous process of looking at the backlog of Epics and applying our tribal knowledge of how big we think each **Epic** is, then calculating our timeline using our known velocity (this assumes that we have been tracking our velocity and maintaining estimate hygiene in our planning sessions).

Our estimate is always (always, always, always) wrong.

There are many reasons why the estimate is always wrong.  It could be that our estimation methodology (usually applied at the **Story** level) doesn't scale to **Epics**.  It could be that, because we haven't started building some parts of the system, we just don't know enough about that part of the system to estimate correctly.  It is OFTEN the case that the team is not invested in a long-range estimation that they know is not going to be accurate and that they are going to be held to once a "date" is communicated.  This is an inherently de-motivating exercise for the team, and is quite dangerous for the health and safety of the team.

So what should we do?

## Why Even Try?
The first question to answer is why we are even trying to estimate work that is in the inception phase of the [cone of uncertainty](http://www.agilenutshell.com/cone_of_uncertainty).  We know that priorities can (and will) shift, so any estimate we give has the potential for error embedded in it by it's nature. The reason that giving estimates (read: "Dates") is that we need to provide visibility to the rest of the business, usually sales and marketing.

**Sales and Marketing** abhors a vacuum.  If we don't give them an idea of when the [big rocks](https://www.estimancy.com/en/2018/11/12/big-rock-how-to-estimate-a-budget-during-an-upstream-phase/) will be moved, they are paralyzed in their communications.  This is especially true of marketing, whose entire function is to communicate to current and potential customers.  A business cannot function without meaningful communication of when products will be ready for the market.

## Strategic Intent vs Accountability Tool
One way to change the narrative and start seeing roadmaps from a more useful perspective is to stop thinking about roadmaps as accountability tools, and start thinking about them as tolls to communicate strategic intent.  By publishing roadmaps that communicate the items we expect to deliver on some timeline, we help other parts of the business (as well as external stakeholders) to understand what direction we are going, and when we expect to make progress in that area.  This enables other teams to plan.  By communicating that our roadmaps contain our strategic direction, there should be a built-in assumption that the timelines provided are subject to change and are imprecise.

## Forecasts vs Estimates
Another tool to shift thinking on what a roadmap represents, and enable partners to plan accordingly, is to provide forecasts rather than estimates.  An estimate is usually conveyed as "We will deliver the Mobile Plutonium Reactor by the second week of June".  A forecast takes a more probabilistic approach, saying something more like "We have 80% confidence that we will deliver the Mobile Plutonium Reactor in Q2".  Forecasts are presented as distributions of dates with confidence scores associated.  

NOTE: the distribution of ranges and confidence scores can be in many shapes and sizes, with different distribution characteristics.  Maybe a topic of a future post...  :smile::thought_balloon:

## Roadmap Formats
If you decide to present roadmaps in terms of forecasts, there are different ways to present the items on the roadmap.  One presentation method is the typical Quarterly view of delivery.  
a quarterly view might look something like this:

Another format that you might use is the Now/Next/Later format, which might look something like this:
<img src='/img/tns-nnl.png'>

There are other formats you might use, but the main elements represented are:
- What are the big rocks that we are working on?
- Where are they in our strategic priorities?
- What is our confidence level that they will be delivered by a given point in our timeline?
