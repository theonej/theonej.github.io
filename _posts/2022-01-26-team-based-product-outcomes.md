# Team-Based Product Outcomes

Once you have decided on your product outcomes at an organizational level, it's time to start talking to the teams about the outcomes they can impact within their product space.  The way in which teams can impact higher-level business goals will vary based on their scope, product, and capacity.

It's important at the beginning to find the strong relationships between the opportunities that the team thinks they can impact, and the outcomes for the business as a whole.  Having a true "North Star" for their outcomes informs the rest of the decisions they make when it comes to outcome planning.  Weak connections to higher-level business goals hurts the alignment of the team to the business, and can lead to cancelled projects or changes in direction.

If you are having trouble identifying how a team can impact the business, you may want to go back and look at the [teams charter](Defining Product Outcomes with Teams), which was presumably created at some point early in the team's history, and should lay out exactly what the team's value to the business is.  

If, after looking at the team's charter you still can't identify how the team's product can ladder up to the agreed-upon business objects, it may be time for some hard questions.  

- Has the direction of the business changed, making the team's product no longer relevant?
- Has the team's product become redundant due to duplicative areas within the organization or acquisitions?
- Have other commercial options, paid or open source, obviated the need for the team's product?

It is important to work through these questions and have a clear understanding of the business impact that the team can contribute to before moving into defining outcomes.

Once a team has identified some opportunities that ladder up to higher-level business outcomes, it's time to start working with the team to understand what outcomes they should be working towards that contribute to the overall goal.

Example:
```
The business has aligned on a goal of increasing ARR by 25% YoY.
```

Most teams will not have the scope to impact this goal in it's entirety, except at very small companies with one or two product lines.  Given that the team wants to create achievable outcomes that can contribute to the larger goal, they might identify the following outcomes:

```
1: Increase MAU by 25% from Q1 to Q3
2: Increase the number of new user signups by 50% YoY
3: Decrease the number of users who cancel their service by 15% YoY by Q2
```

There are four important components of each goal that are worth understanding: **The Directional Component**, **The Primary Metric**, **The Target**, and **The UOM**.

#### The Directional Component
The directional component makes it clear from the outcome definition how we want user behavior to be impacted (`Increase` or `Decrease`, in this example).

#### The Primary Metric
The second important component is the metric we will primarily target in the outcome.  It's important to have a clear, measurable metric that ideally can be expressed as a number (as opposed to a nebulous concept such as customer happiness) so we can understand if we are making progress towards the objective.  In this case the metrics `MAU`, `number of new user signups`, and `number of users who cancel their service` are all discreet metrics that can be measured and reduced to easy-to-understand numbers.

#### The Target
The target tells us when we have been successful, and provides a benchmark against which we can compare our progress on an ongoing basis.  Good targets should be concrete measurements and not abstract concepts (e.g. "increase sign ups by *a significant amount*).  The less ambiguity there is in the target definition, the more tightly aligned everyone can be on determining progress to the goal.

#### The UOM (Unit of Measure)
The unit of measure is often overlooked, but is absolutely critical in pacing to goals.  The Unit of measure should usually be a time-based UOM (although I am sure there are other UOMs that could be used).  In this example we have `Q1 to Q3`, `YoY`, and `by Q2`.  Each UOM provides a clear amount of time that we are looking to spend on the outcome, and provides us visibility at all times how much time we have left to get to our stated goal for the outcome.

It may take several iterations to negotiate the outcomes for the team.  Often the teams will have a very different idea of how to impact the higher-level business objectives than the team leaders, which is obviously a good thing.  

## Negotiating the outcomes that best support the business while playing to the team's strengths and empowering the team to find solutions strengthens the buy-in from all participants.

In the next post, I'll dive into the technical aspects of defining Targets, including tracking metrics, mapping targets to times (and specifically not to dates), tracking progress, communicating risk, and providing visibility.
